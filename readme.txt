To fully test you will need an arduino with: 
hco5 blutooth module 
ultrasonic sensor
digital temperature and humidity sensor
1kohm resistor
2kohm resistor 
wires
breadboard(optional)


ground and 5v to components 

hco5 -> tx to voltage divider -> middle of voltage divider ~ 3.3v to rx hco5
		rx to hco5 tx
		
		digital pins to ultrasonic sensors and dht
		
		
		
		
		
pair hco5 to android phone 
password = "1234"


launch app 


when adding a ripple enter dimensions from ultrasonic sensor to bottom of container and depth of water  (both in cm)
